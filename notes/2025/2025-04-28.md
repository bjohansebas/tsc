- **Owner:** Nitin + TSC
- **Timeline:** 2–4 weeks (dependent on contributor availability).
- **Dependencies:** Requires approval from TSC and clear communication of roles.
- **Outcome:** Scoped WGs with defined responsibilities and access levels.

#### **2. Automate Releases**

**Objective:** Replace manual release processes to improve efficiency.

- **Actions:**
  - Research existing tools (e.g., GitHub Actions, semantic release).
  - Propose automation workflow for versioning, changelog generation, and deployment.
  - Validate feasibility with current contributors (e.g., Alex).
- **Owner:** Nitin
- **Timeline:** 3–6 weeks (post-WG setup).
- **Dependencies:** Requires collaboration with core contributors to align on tooling.
- **Outcome:** Draft proposal for automated release pipeline.

#### **3. Improve Meeting Infrastructure**

**Objective:** Streamline meeting logistics and documentation.

- **Actions:**
  - Adopt ESLint/Node.js templates for agenda generation (e.g., `generate-transcript.js`).

#### **4. Roadmapping via GitHub Projects**

**Objective:** Use GitHub Projects for centralized, org-wide roadmaps.

- **Actions:**
  - Migrate from Kanban board to a unified GitHub Project (repo-neutral).
  - Align WGs with project boards to track cross-repo dependencies.
  - Integrate milestones for core releases and OKRs (if feasible).
- **Owner:** Nitin + TSC
- **Timeline:** Ongoing, with initial setup in 2 weeks.
- **Dependencies:** WG structure must be finalized first.
- **Outcome:** GitHub Project serving as a single source of truth for roadmaps.

#### **5. Meeting Transcript Automation**

**Objective:** Standardize and automate post-meeting documentation.

- **Actions:**
  - Deploy scripts from ESLint/Node.js to generate transcripts.
  - Validate with Claudio’s proposed `generate-transcript.js` tool.
  - Ensure compatibility with existing repositories.
- **Owner:** Claudio + Even
- **Timeline:** 2–3 weeks.
- **Dependencies:** Requires GitHub Actions setup and testing.
- **Outcome:** Automated, version-controlled transcripts for all TSC meetings.
